This folder contains the plott widget program for plotting, zooming, panning, saving 1D and 2D data.
It also contains the underlying cw_draw2d.pro widget that you can use in your own widget programs.
Each routine has an extensive header explaining how they work.

files in the main directory (alphabetically):

* cp_shaded.pro       : routine generates a shaded (or not shaded) contour plot, with (or without) colorbar.
                        it has evolved from the cp_shade.pro routine by R. Martin
* cp_surf.pro         : routine generates a shaded (or not shaded) surface plot, with (or without) contours and/or colorbar.
                        it has evolved from the cp_shade.pro routine by R. Martin
* cw_draw2d.pro       : widget that allow you to show 2D or 1D data as profiles, time traces, contour or surface plot (in
                        different colour schemes). it allows zooming (middle button drag), panning (left button drag),
                        selecting (left button click), resetting (right button click) and  saving to .eps and .png.
                        you can also add errorbars, overplot data and add an extra legend.
                        this widget uses TeXtoIDL so the TeXtoIDL routines should be in your path
* legend.pro          : routine to add a legend to an IDL plot
* plott.pro           : program that uses the cw_draw2d widget (and therefore has all its functionality). It is
                        meant to be similar to the standard plot command in IDL. e.g.
                          IDL> plott, x, y, error=dy, errstyle=1, col='ff'x, thick=2
                             => 1D plot of y(x) with normal errorbars in red, thickness 2
                          IDL> plott, x, y, z, error=dz, errstyle=0, ptype=2
                             => 2D plot of z(x,y). It will open the plot window as a contour plot (ptype=2)
                                but the selector at the left top of the plot window allows you to change this
                                to a 1D z(x, fixed y) plot (ptype=0), a 1D z(y, fixed x) plot (ptype=1) or
                                a 2D surface plot (ptype=3). In the 1D plots the z-error will be indicated by a 
                                shaded area (errstyle=0) rather than normal error bars (errstyle=1)
                          IDL> plott, x0, y0, extralgd={text:['y0(x0)','y1(x1)'],color=['black','red']}, id=my_plot
                          IDL> plott, x1, y1, col='red', overplot=my_plot
                             => 1D plot of y0(x1) in black overplotted with y1(x1) in red, with a legend
* save_dialog.pro     : widget for saving the cw_draw2d data as .eps or .png file.
